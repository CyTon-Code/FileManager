what to do: "Now I'm starting to solve the problem."

if "I was able to start solving the problem now":
-    say: "I have already begun to solve the problem!"

if "I could not start solving the problem":
-    they say, "I just couldn't solve the problem!"

after:
    if "I have already started solving the problem":
