PAT-1 - Public ANT Template - Documentation with examples of solving
problems by built-in modules. Rules for writing a good inline module.

Motto: "Discretion is our everything!"

    # pseudocode:
    todo "Now I'm starting to solve the problem."
    
    if "I was able to start solving the problem now":
        say "I have already begun to solve the problem!"
    
    if "I could not start solving the problem":
        say "I just couldn't solve the problem!"
    
    after:
        if "I have already started solving the problem":
            todo "last steps before exiting the process."
            todo "Remove trash."

This template will be extended and will also be used in the check_open
built-in module.
