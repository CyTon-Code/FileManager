# I'm in development
# FileManager
"The terminal as I see it!" this is an application for working with files.

The development of this section has been suspended due to the following development priorities for these sections:
- Built-in modules.
- Additional modules.


After reaching the release of most of the modules, of course, I will start developing the interface itself, built on modules - the terminal core (TerModule - FileManager).

I already tried to write such an interface, but it was a bad idea.

I plan to first adopt the rules - How to write modules correctly.

This interface must follow the rules of the module, not the other way around.
